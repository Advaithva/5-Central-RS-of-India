		<h2> 1. Mumbai Central </H2>
		<p>Mumbai Central (formerly Bombay Central, station code: MMCT) is a major railway station on the Western line, situated in Mumbai, Maharashtra. It serves as a major stop for both Local and Inter-City/Express trains with separate platforms for them. It is also a terminal for several long-distance trains including the Mumbai Rajdhani Express. It is one of the five major Terminal stations in Mumbai while others being Mumbai CST, Mumbai LTT, Mumbai BDTS and Mumbai Dadar. Trains depart from the station connecting various destinations mostly across states in the northern, western and north-western parts of India. It was designed by the British architect Claude Batley, and constructed by the Shapoorji Pallonji in 1930 in a record time of 21 months. The project was then costed INR 15.6 million.

The station is divided into two parts. The eastern half of the station serves long-distance trains operated by Western Railways while the western half serves commuter trains running on the Churchgateâ€“Virar suburban section of Western Railways. The mainline section has five high level platforms terminating in a large concourse on the southern end. The suburban section has four high level platforms. All the platforms are connected by foot overbridges and the mainline platforms are wheelchair accessible from the south end. A large Passenger Reservation Center with several ticket windows is located on the east side of the mainline station. Tickets between any two stations in India on any train offering reserved accommodation can be purchased from this facility. There are many Unreserved Ticket Counters in the main concourse for purchasing unreserved tickets for immediate travel on express and passenger trains starting from Mumbai Central.  RailTel, the telecom arm of the Indian Railways, on 22 January 2016 launched free public Wi-Fi service at Mumbai Central station in collaboration with Google.

 The century-old building of the railway station, designed by architect George Harding, is one of the most prominent landmarks of Chennai. The station was renamed twice; first to reflect the name change of the city from Madras to Chennai in 1996 it was renamed from Madras Central to Chennai Central, and then to honour the AIADMK founder and the former Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu M. G. Ramachandran, it was renamed as Puratchi Thalaivar Dr. M.G. Ramachandran Central Railway Station on 5 April 2019. About 550,000 passengers use the terminus every day, making it the busiest railway station in South India.[6] Along with Chennai Egmore and Coimbatore Junction, the Central terminus is among the most profitable stations of Southern Railways.[7] As per a report published in 2007 by the Indian Railways, Chennai Central and Secunderabad were awarded 183 points out of a maximum of 300 for cleanliness, the highest in the country. Madras Central was built in 1873 at Parktown as a second terminus to decongest the Royapuram harbour station, which was being utilised for port movements. The terminus lies on the southern arm of the diamond junction of Chennai's railway network, where all the lines of the Chennai Suburban Railway meet. The terminus is located about 19 km from Chennai International Airport. 

<br><br> 

Chennai Central is a terminal station with bay platforms. The average length of railway tracks in the station is 600 metres.[26] The entire complex has 17 platforms to handle long-distance trains with 5 platforms exclusively for suburban trains. The total length of the station is about 950 m. The main building has 12 platforms and handles long-distance trains. The complex for suburban trains is popularly known as the Moore Market complex. There is a platform 2A between platforms 2 and 3; it is used to handle short-length trains like the Chennai Rajadhani Express, Vijayawada Jan Shatabdi Express, Bengaluru Shatabdi Express, Mysuru Shatabdi Express and the Gudur Passenger. The 13-storied annex building, the Moore Market Complex building, has 5 platforms and handles north- and westbound suburban trains. The station has bookshops, restaurants, accommodation facilities, internet browsing centres, and a shopping mall. The main waiting hall can hold up to 1,000 people.[35] In spite of being the most important terminus of the region, the station lacks several facilities such as coach position display boards.[36] The main concourses too have long exhausted their capacity to handle the increasing passenger crowd.

<br><br> 

 There are passenger operated enquiry terminals and seven touch-screen PNR status machines in the station.[38] The station has three split-flap timing boards,[39] electronic display boards and plasma TVs that mention train timings and platform number.[31][40] A passenger information center in the station has been upgraded with "Spot your Train" live train display facility, information kiosks and passenger digital assistance booths.[29] The terminus, however, has only 10 toilets, which is inadequate to its 350,000 passengers. </p>

 Mangalore Central comes under the Southern Railway and also provides connectivity for Konkan Railway and South Western Railway of the Indian Railways. Mangalore Central railway station is located at Old Kent road, Hampankatta. Rail connectivity in Mangalore was established in 1907. A metre-gauge railway track, built through the Western Ghats, connected Mangalore with Hassan. The metre-gauge track was converted to a broad-gauge track connecting Mangalore to Bangalore via Hassan. The re-gauged track was opened to freight traffic in May 2006 and passenger traffic in December 2007. A railway siding leads from Mangalore Central to the historic old Railway Goods-Shed in the old Port, Bunder area of Mangalore city.

 For a year 1929â€“1930 the longest running train in undivided India originated from Mangalore Central. This was the Grand Trunk Express from Mangalore to Peshawar. The train covered the distance from Mangalore to Peshawar on the Khyber Pass in 104 hours. After 1930 the route of the Grand Trunk Express was curtailed and the train originated from Mettupalayam, Coimbatore. Trains from here connect the city to prominent state capitals of India like Chennai, Bangalore, Hyderabad, Thiruvananthapuram (via Southern Railway), Mumbai, Thane, Delhi, Ajmer, Ahmedabad (via Konkan Railways) and so forth. It is also well connected with Mysore, Ratnagiri (Maharashtra), Madgoan (Goa), Byndur Mookambika road, Udupi, Kannur, Ernakulam and Coimbatore railway stations. </p>

Kanpur Central has undergone a beautification and modernisation effort in recent years, especially following the inclusion of the station in the "50 World-Class Railway Stations" budget, which sought to modernise Indian railway stations, by former Minister of Railways Mamata Banerjee. These efforts mainly include the improvement of services offered to customers and the redevelopment of existing features, such as the installation of a new platform surface at platform number one. The current phase of development is mainly focused on the cleaning up of the side of the station facing the city, with â‚¹15 million being budgeted to go towards the project.

A food plaza is designated to be built on the second floor and two new car parks are also being proposed. According to a NCR report the station needs at least 10 more platforms to support the ever-increasing passenger amount. At present, the re-modelling work is proceeding very slowly, but senior NCR officials are hopeful of keeping their promises. A three-layer underground car park has been proposed as well as the installation of two escalators leading to the footbridges passing over the railway lines. By 2010 a new footbridge was constructed at the west end of the station.</p>
